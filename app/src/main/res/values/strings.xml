        The last verse of Purgatorio 26, referring to Arnaut Daniel, is “Poi sascose nel foco che li affina” (Then he hid himself in the
        fire that refines them )
        In Purgtorio 27 we learn that the refining fire of the seventh
        terrace must be confronted by every soul that passes beyond the terraces of purgatory
        In other words, the fire of the seventh terrace is not only the designated
        punishment of the terrace
        of lust it burns away and “refines” any remaining inclination to vice in all
        souls as they complete purgation
        Dantes fear of the fire is such that Virgilio needs to remind him of all the
        fear-inducing experiences that they have shared in the course of their
        time together and all the times that Virgilio took care of him and kept
        him safe. This is quite a personal moment between the pilgrim and his
        guide, in which they look
        back over their long and companionable journey The moment that Virgilio
        singles out as most emblematic of the pilgrims fear is their flight on the
        back of the monster Geryon (Inferno 17)
        A summer river being crossed
        Now I find particularly fascinating in Virgilios words his emphasis on time and memory “Ricorditi, ricorditi!”
        (Remember remember Time and memory are the currencies of human affect and love affect accrues
        over time and is preserved in memory
        how pleasing
        with sandals in my hands!

        Light of the moon
        Moves west, flowers shadows
        Creep eastward

        Everything I touch
        with tenderness, alas,
        pricks like a bramble
